# using tab in print statement:
print("here \t I put tab and here \t again")

# using new line in print statement:
print("here I put a \n new line and here I do it again \n new line")

# here I use quotes:
print("I try to use 'single quotes' and then I use \"double quotes\"")
# the same result:
print('I try to use \'single quotes\' and then I use "double quotes"')
# it works here as well
print('I try to use \'single quotes\' and then I use \"double quotes\"')

# printing back slashes:
print("If i want to print \\ I have to add two back slashes.")
