# create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs
example_dict = {"name": "Tomas", "age": 28, "country": "Slovakia", "city": "Kosice", "mode": "learning"}

# print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
print(example_dict["country"])  # prints Slovakia

# use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result
print("city" in example_dict)  # prints True

# use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result
print("address" not in example_dict)  # prints True
