# use .fromkeys() to create a dictionary that has the consonants from the alphabet
# as its keys and the string "consonant" as the value for each of those keys.
# Only use lower case letters for the consonants.
# "y" counts as a consonant for this exercise.
# Use a for loop and the .items() method to print each of those key: value pairs on a different line.
# For example, the first 3 lines in the output should be the following:
#
# b consonant
#
# c consonant
#
# d consonant

for key, value in {}.fromkeys("bcdfghjklmnqprstvwxyz", "consontant").items():
    print(key, value)

# paste this dictionary into your .py file then pop and print "Big Mac" from it
fast_food_items = {"McDonald's": "Big Mac", "Burger King": "Whopper", "Chick-fil-A": "Original Chicken Sandwich"}

print(fast_food_items["McDonald's"]) # prints Big Mac

# use .popitem() to remove the last key: value pair from the dictionary assigned to fast_food_items
# then print new fast_food_items dictionary.
fast_food_items.popitem()
print(fast_food_items)
