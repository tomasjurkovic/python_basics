tuple_6 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
print(tuple_6[2])  # prints 3, because it access the 2. index -> 0, 1, 2...

# we can use slice to print values from tuple as well:
print(tuple_6[:8])  # prints (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
print(tuple_6[2:7])  # prints (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
print(tuple_6[3:])  # prints (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
